# FlappyJet2 üõ©Ô∏è
"FlappyJet" was the first game I made with Unity. Since then, I improved a lot (I'm still bad though), so I wanted to remake it 
from scratch, add new features to it, and even release it on PC, mobile, and browser.

The original game was just an experiment to recreate Flappy Bird, and it was pretty bad since there was no procedural world generation. <br>
Therefore, the map would end at some point, and it would always be the same. Additionally, the game didn't have any system to save or <br> 
track your score and coins.<br>

In this new version, you can collect coins to buy new planes in the shop, and the game will save your score. I have also added a bot that
you can play against.

**Please note that the game is not finished yet, and I will rewrite every line of code that isn't appropriate.**
